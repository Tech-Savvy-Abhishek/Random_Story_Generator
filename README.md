## ⚙️ How It Works

The story is assembled from 5 parts:
- `intro`
- `dailyEventSegment`
- `conflictSegment`
- `twistSegment`
- `resolutionSegment`

Each part is randomly selected from a predefined array of story templates. The selected template strings contain placeholders like `{name}`, `{temp}`, `{weight}`, and `{distance}`, which are dynamically replaced based on user input or defaults.

The entire story is then typed out one character at a time using a **typewriter effect**, which enhances the visual appeal and suspense of the story.

## ✨ The Typewriter Effect (In Detail)

The **typewriter effect** can seem a bit magical at first because it behaves like a loop, but doesn’t use a typical `for` or `while` loop. Instead, it relies on **recursion with a delay** using `setTimeout`. Let’s break it down step-by-step to understand how it works.

---

### 🔍 The Typewriter Function – Line by Line

```javascript
let i = 0;
function type() {
    if (i < content.length) {
        element.textContent += content.charAt(i);
        i++;
        setTimeout(type, 30); // Call 'type' again after 30 milliseconds
    }
}
````

---

### 🔁 How it works without a loop:

The trick is this line:

```javascript
setTimeout(type, 30);
```

This **schedules** the `type()` function to run **again after 30 milliseconds** — so instead of looping immediately like `while` or `for`, it's calling itself after a short delay.

This is called **recursion with a delay**.

---

## 🧠 Here's what's happening step-by-step:

### First time:

* `i = 0`
* `type()` is called.
* It checks `if (i < content.length)` → true.
* It adds the first character (`content.charAt(0)`) to the screen.
* `i++` becomes `1`.
* `setTimeout(type, 30)` tells the browser: “Call `type()` again in 30ms”.

### Second time (after 30ms):

* `i = 1`
* `type()` runs again.
* It adds the second character.
* `i++` becomes `2`.
* `setTimeout(type, 30)` again.

### ...and so on:

This continues until `i` reaches `content.length`, at which point `if (i < content.length)` becomes false and the function **stops calling itself**.

---

## 🧠 Why not use a regular loop?

You **can't use a normal loop with `setTimeout`** if you want pauses between each character. This would **immediately** loop and schedule everything at once, which defeats the purpose of animation.

This:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < content.length; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        element.textContent += content.charAt(i);
    }, 30);
}
```

...would actually print **all characters at once** after 30ms if you’re not careful — or would print them **out of sync** without calculating increasing delay for each one.
